# OKCupid Profile Clustering  
### Identifying User Archetypes with Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
 
**Course Project:** Unsupervised Learning / Clustering Analysis

---

## Project Overview

This project applies **agglomerative hierarchical clustering** to online dating profiles from OKCupid to identify meaningful user segments based on **lifestyle behavior** and **socioeconomic status**.

**Goal:**  
Identify distinct, interpretable user archetypes that capture behavioral and income-based differences among users.

**Dataset:**  
- OKCupid profiles dataset  
- ~383 users after data cleaning  

**Final Output:**  
- 3 primary user clusters  
- 1 small outlier cluster

## Methodology Summary

### Chosen Features
We selected two variables for clustering:

1. **Unhealthy Score**
   - Composite metric derived from:
     - Drinking habits
     - Smoking habits
     - Drug usage
   - Encoded numerically and normalized to a 0–1 scale

2. **Income**
   - Converted to numeric values
   - Missing values filled with the median
   - Standardized for clustering

**Why these features?**
- Unhealthy score captures **social behavior & lifestyle**
- Income captures **socioeconomic status**
- This combination produced the clearest and most distinct clusters compared to other tested variables (e.g., age, height)

## Clustering Approach

### Algorithm
- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Complete Linkage**

### Why Agglomerative Clustering?
- Dataset size is relatively small
- Many original variables are categorical
- Does not assume spherical clusters
- Allows for hierarchical user groupings
- Deterministic (same result every run)
- Handles uneven cluster sizes well

### Why Complete Linkage?
- Measures the **maximum distance** between clusters
- Produces tighter, more compact clusters
- Reduces chaining effects
- Provides better separation than single linkage

## Determining the Number of Clusters

Using the dendrogram:
- A large jump in merge distance occurs between **4 → 3 clusters**
- We selected **4 clusters** as optimal
- One cluster is treated as an **outlier group**

---

## Final Clusters

Each user profile is assigned to one of the following clusters:

| Cluster Name | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **Wild, Low-Income** | High unhealthy score, lower income |
| **Chill, High-Income** | Low unhealthy score, higher income |
| **Chill, Low-Income** | Low unhealthy score, lower income |
| **Balanced Social Outliers** | Small outlier group with balanced behavior |

## Analysis & Visualizations

The project includes the following visual outputs:

- **Dendrogram** showing hierarchical cluster structure
- **Scatter Plot**
  - X-axis: Unhealthy Score
  - Y-axis: Income
  - Each color represents a cluster
  - Cluster centroids marked with red “X”
- **Bar Charts**
  - Average unhealthy score per cluster
  - Average income per cluster

Cluster centroids are computed by averaging:
- Unhealthy score
- Income  
within each cluster.

## Business Implications
- **Personalized Matching:**  
  OkCupid can improve match quality by tailoring recommendations based on lifestyle–income compatibility rather than relying solely on surface-level attributes.

- **Targeted Marketing & Monetization:**  
  Different clusters represent **distinct willingness-to-pay and engagement patterns**.  
  - High-income, low-risk users may respond better to premium subscriptions.  
  - Socially active or higher-risk users may engage more with event-based or experiential features.
